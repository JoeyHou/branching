## Dataset
This is the dataset for our paper *Choice-75: A Dataset on Decision Branching in Script Learning*.

### Overall Structure
- `dataset_key.json`: stores the mapping from `goal` to `split` (e.g. `train`, `dev`, `test`); the `goal` is the goal from `proScript` (Note that `test` data annotation is not provided in the current version)
- `index_key.json`: stores the mapping from `goal` to index, which is used to name `.json` files (e.g. script #1 => `1.json`).
- `user_profile`, `verb_phrase_manual`, `verb_phrase_machine`: folders for the data, organized by split

### Data Fields
- `goal`: text from `proScript` (str)
- `steps`: list of steps (list[str])
- `original_index`: original index in the `proScript` dataset
- `index`: index in our file system (i.e. the following example would be `5.json`)
- `branching_info`: branching-related daata fields
	- `branching_step`: the step that has branches  
	- `branching_idx`: index of `branching_step` in the original `steps` list
	- `option 1`, `option 2`: two options for the `branching_step` 
	- `dataset`: dataset split
	- `freeform_ra`: scenarios, each scenario data point consists of [scenario, ground truth option, level of difficulties].

**Note:** you can safely disregard any field that is not noted above, they are not related to the current phase of this project.
