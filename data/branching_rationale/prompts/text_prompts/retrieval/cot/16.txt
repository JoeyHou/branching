CONTEXT
- Goal: go back in time
- Previous Actions: 
  1. decided to go back in time
  2. go to school for quantum mechanics
CURRENT EVENT
go to school for quantum mechanics
ALTERNATIVE OPTIONS
- Option_1: go to a class at a university
- Option_2: go to a class at a community college
RELATED RATIONALES
- [cost] effort / manpower
- [cost] money / materials
- [cost] time
- [outcome] emotional / physical rewards
- [outcome] more options / variety
- [outcome] reliability / certainty / chance of success
QUESTION
Does Option_1 and Option_2 have a difference in the RELATED RATIONALES?
ANSWER- [cost] effort / manpower:
    - Explanation: In most cases, the human effort required for going to a class at a university is more than that of going to a class at a community college.
    - Conclusion: Option_1 and Option_2 DO HAVE a difference in terms of [cost] effort / manpower.
- [cost] money / materials:
    - Explanation: In most cases, the money or materials required for a university is more than that for a community college
    - Conclusion: Option_1 and Option_2 DO HAVE a difference in terms of [cost] money / materials
- [cost] time:
    - Explanation: In most cases, the time required for going to a university (around 4 years) is more than that of going to a community college (around 2 years).
    - Conclusion: Option_1 and Option_2 DO HAVE a difference in terms of [cost] time
- [outcome] emotional / physical rewards:
    - Explanation: In most cases, the emotional rewards bring up by going to a university is more than going to a community college since the first one makes people feel more prouded and sense of achievement
    - Conclusion: Option_1 and Option_2 DO HAVE a difference in terms of [outcome] emotional / physical rewards
- [outcome] more options / variety:
    - Explanation: In most cases, the availability of university or community college depends on the location, which makes it hard to conclude with one has more options or varieties.
    - Conclusion: Option_1 and Option_2 DO NOT HAVE a difference in terms of [outcome] more options / variety
- [outcome] reliability / certainty / chance of success:
    - Explanation: go back in time is the goal here. In most cases, go to university would provide more in depth knowledge about quantum mechanics than community colleges, making the option 1 more reliable
    - Conclusion: Option_1 and Option_2 DO HAVE a difference in terms of [outcome]reliability / certainty / chance of success.
