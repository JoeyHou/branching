QUESTION
Does Option_1 and Option_2 have a difference in the RELATED RATIONALES?
ANSWER
- [cost] effort / manpower:
    - Explanation: In most cases, the human effort required for putting on a reusable mask and an n-95 single-use mask are similar to each other: they both require little effort.
    - Conclusion: Option_1 and Option_2 DO NOT HAVE a difference in terms of [cost] effort / manpower.
- [cost] money / materials:
    - Explanation: In most cases, a reusable mask would cost much less than an n-95 single-use mask, not to mention a reusable mask can be reused and save more.
    - Conclusion: Option_1 and Option_2 DO HAVE a difference in terms of [cost] money / materials
- [cost] time:
    - Explanation: In most cases, the time required to put on a reusable mask and an n-95 does not differ by too much: they both only take a few seconds
    - Conclusion: Option_1 and Option_2 DO NOT HAVE a difference in terms of [cost] time
- [outcome] emotional / physical rewards:
    - Explanation: In most cases, wearing an n-95 mask would provide more protection against the environment than wearing a reusable mask, making the first option more healthy
    - Conclusion: Option_1 and Option_2 DO HAVE a difference in terms of [outcome] emotional / physical rewards
- [outcome] more options / variety:
    - Explanation: In most cases, neither reusable mask or n-95 mask could provide too much variety in terms of options or outcome
    - Conclusion: Option_1 and Option_2 DO NOT HAVE a difference in terms of [outcome] more options / variety
- [outcome] reliability / certainty / chance of success:
    - Explanation: Protect ourselves with mask is the goal here. In most cases, wearing an n-95 mask would provide more protection against the environment than wearing a reusable mask, making the first option more reliable
    - Conclusion: Option_1 and Option_2 DO HAVE a difference in terms of [outcome]reliability / certainty / chance of success.
