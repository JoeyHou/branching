- Goal: go back in time
- Step: go to school for quantum mechanics
- Option_1: go to a class at a university
- Option_2: go to a class at a community college
- Conclusion: Option_2 is more effort-saving than Option_1, because:
    - For Option_1, taking a class in university would likely to be stressful as research shows university students are the group with a high stress level.
