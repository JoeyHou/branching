CONTEXT
- Goal: go back in time
- Step: go to school for quantum mechanics
- Option_1: go to a class at a university
- Option_2: go to a class at a community college
RELATED RATIONALES
- [cost] effort / manpower
- [cost] money / materials
- [cost] time
- [outcome] emotional / physical rewards
- [outcome] reliability / certainty / chance of success
QUESTION
For every rationale in RELATED RATIONALES, which one of Option_1 and Option_2 is the better choice?
ANSWER
- [cost] effort / manpower
    - Explanation:
        - For Option_1, taking a class in university would likely to be stressful as research shows university students are the group with a high stress level.
        - For Option_2, taking a class in a community college is most likely not too stressful since community college are designed for basic level of education.
        - Doing something that is less stressful is more effort-saving than doing something that could be stressful.
    - Conclusion: The effort-saving option is Option_2.
- [cost] money / materials
    - Explanation:
        - For Option_1, on average, a class in a university can take a few thousand dollars and finanacial aid is limited.
        - For Option_2, taking a class in a community college can take a few hundred dollars, or even free in some cases.
        - A few hundred dollars or free tuition is better than a few thousand dollars and limited financial aid.
    - Conclusion: The affordable option is Option_2.
- [cost] time
    - Explanation:
        - For Option_1, in most cases, university education takes four to five years to finish.
        - For Option_2, in most cases, a degree from community college takes two to three years to finish.
        - Two to three years is less than four to five years.
    - Conclusion: The time-saving option is Option_2.
- [outcome] emotional / physical rewards
    - Explanation:
        - For Option_1, a university would provide lots of extracurricular activitis and networking oppertunities, making the education more comprehensive.
        - For Option_2, a community college would mostly focus on the skills and no more benifits.
        - Extracurricular activities and networking opptertunities are more benifitial in the long term than basic classes on skills.
    - Conclusion: The option that brings more benifit is Option_1.
- [outcome] reliability / certainty / chance of success
    - Explanation:
        - For Option_1, in most cases, a university would have a physics deparment to provide classes for quantum mechanics.
        - For Option_2, a community college might not have a physics deparment so it might not offer a class in quantum mechanics. 
        - The place that is almost certain to have the quantum mechanics class is more reliable than the place that might not offer the class.
    - Conclusion: The more reliable option is Option_1.
