QUESTION
For every rationale in RELATED RATIONALES, which one of Option_1 and Option_2 is the better choice?
ANSWER
- [cost] effort / manpower
    - Explanation:
        - For Option_1, the closest store would require the least effort to get to.
        - For Option_2, the store with the most options would require some extra effort to get to, depending on the distance.
        - Going to somewhere very close by is easier than going to somewhere that is not very close by.
    - Conclusion: The effort-saving option is Option_1.
- [cost] time
    - Explanation:
        - For Option_1, the closest store would require the least time to get to.
        - For Option_2, the store with the most options would require some extra time to get to, depending on the distance and transportation.
        - Going to somewhere very close by is faster than going to somewhere that is not very close by.
    - Conclusion: The time-saving option is Option_1.
- [outcome] more options / variety
    - Explanation:
        - For Option_1, the closest store would provide the average amount of options to select from.
        - For Option_2, the store with the most options would provide the most options to select from, more than any other store.
        - The most options to choose from is more than the average amount of options.
    - Conclusion: The option that provides more potential options is Option_2.
- [outcome] reliability / certainty / chance of success
    - Explanation:
        - For Option_1, the closest store is likely to have milk, but with limited options, people might not get what they want.
        - For Option_2, the store with the most options would likely have any milk a person could image, making it more likely to achieve the goal.
        - Store with most options is more reliable than very limited options.
    - Conclusion: The more reliable option is Option_2.
