CONTEXT
- Goal: go back in time
- Previous Actions: 
  1. decided to go back in time
  2. go to school for quantum mechanics
CURRENT EVENT
go to school for quantum mechanics
ALTERNATIVE OPTIONS
- Option_1: go to a class at a university
- Option_2: go to a class at a community college
RELATED RATIONALES
- [cost] effort / manpower
- [cost] money / materials
- [cost] time
- [outcome] emotional / physical rewards
- [outcome] reliability / certainty / chance of success
QUESTION
For every rationale in RELATED RATIONALES, which one of Option_1 and Option_2 is the better choice?
ANSWER
- [cost] effort / manpower
    - Explanation: In most cases, the human effort required for going to a class at a university is more than that of going to a class at a community college.
    - Conclusion: Option_2 is better than Option_1 when it comes to the "[cost] effort / manpower".
- [cost] money / materials
    - Explanation: In most cases, the money or materials required for a university is more than that for a community college
    - Conclusion: Option_2 is better than Option_1 when it comes to the "[cost] money / materials".
- [cost] time
    - Explanation: In most cases, the time required for going to a university (around 4 years) is more than that of going to a community college (around 2 years).
    - Conclusion: Option_2 is better than Option_1 when it comes to the "[cost] time".
- [outcome] emotional / physical rewards
    - Explanation: In most cases, the emotional rewards bring up by going to a university is more than going to a community college since the first one makes people feel more prouded and sense of achievement
    - Conclusion: Option_1 is better than Option_2 when it comes to the "[outcome] emotional / physical rewards".
- [outcome] reliability / certainty / chance of success
    - Explanation: learn quantum mechanics and go back in time are the goals here. In most cases, go to university would provide more in depth knowledge about quantum mechanics than community colleges, making the option 1 more reliable
    - Conclusion: Option_1 is better than Option_2 when it comes to the "reliability / certainty / chance of success".
