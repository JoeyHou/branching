    - Conclusion: Option_1 and Option_2 DO NOT HAVE a difference in terms of [cost] time
- [outcome] emotional / physical rewards:
    - Explanation: In most cases, the emotional or physical rewards bring up by lifting the skeleton on one's own and to ask the cashier do not differ by too much: neither of them provide any reward
